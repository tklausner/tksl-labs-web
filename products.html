        Gonorrhea is a very common disease impacting over 85,000,000 people a
        year. Unteated gonorrhea can cause complications in men and women
        including chronic pain and infertilty. In pregnant women untreated
        gonorrhea can cause premature birth and neonatal blindess.
        Unfortunately, gonorrhea is becoming increasingly resistant to common
        antibiotics and harder to treat. The US CDC currently recommends
        gonorrhea treatment with a single injection of ceftriaxone In Asia, up
        to 10% of cases of gonorrhea may be resistant to ceftriaxone. Resistant
        cases have also been reported in the United Kingdom and Australia.
